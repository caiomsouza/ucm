# Relative importance
# We can calculate the relative importance of the variables we used in the model using the relaimpo package. The relative importance of the variables used in our model will tell you which variables are providing the most effect on your results. In other words, out of all of the variables available, which should we pay the most attention to. Most of the time, you can only afford to investigate a few. In this case, maybe we are a buyer looking to see what factors are most affecting the value of houses and direct our search where those factors are maximized.
